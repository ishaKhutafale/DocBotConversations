<h2>Project Name: DocBotConversations </h2>
<br>
<p>
  Making PDFs Easy to Understand! Have you ever struggled to find information buried in a PDF document? 
  With DocBotConversations, that's a thing of the past! Our tool turns complex PDFs into friendly chats. 
  Just ask questions, and DocBotConversations will find the answers for you. Say goodbye to endless searching !
  Powered by cutting-edge technologies like the Lamma Index framework, Lamma2 model, and gradient embeddings,the project offers a user-friendly experience 
  where asking questions from a PDF feels as natural as having a conversation.
  Also for saving the chat history of the login user we have used sqlite3 database.And the reason for choosing this framework and model is 
  as they are open source and best suited for RAG (Retrival Augmented Generation) applications.
